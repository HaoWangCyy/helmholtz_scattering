# helmholtz_scattering problem
We condider both sound-soft and sound-hard diffraction problems by a radius one sphere.
We solve those problems using bempp.
We compute the coefficients of the harmonic functions.
We compare the error of the Cauchy Data.

#Notes:
Sound-soft problem tested with a number of precision and frequencies.
Work in progress for Sound-hard problem.
Calculus of volumic exact solutions not done yet.
